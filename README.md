APs = Access points (routers or mobile hotspots)
STs = Stations (any devices MAC address with their WIFI on around you)
SSIDs = Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs is an acronym for Service Set Identifiers. It is a technical term for the name of a wireless network. 
	With this feature, you can create fake SSIDs or clone the name of your target. I donâ€™t suggest you use this feature when you are doing an important attack with lots of targets.)

DEAUTH = you know this attack just simply take down a wifi and users wont be able to use it anymore unless you stop your attack. 
		( note that after starting an attack some devices wont get disconnect from the target WIFI but they will lose their connection like the router doesnt have internet connection )

BEACON = you use this attack in order to craete fake APs names.
		(you can use the SSIDs feuture in sellect menu to clone a AP name or create fake ones in order to destract the user from finding the network that he want)

PROBE = to be honest i dont have that much information about this attack but i know that this attack make noisees so the STs lose the ability to connect to a network again 

!note!: the stronger your antenna get the more you can find and take down.
